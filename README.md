a Calculaor to find how old something is
This was programmed for my own use to be able to remember how old my new baby was without having to do maths
So I did several hours of maths to make an app to do that maths for me in the future.

Currently this project is missing some TLC for UI and UX
I do want to add a config option to change the default date away from my child's birthday

The UI is currently designed for mobile screen in protaint mode

The program is written in GMS2.3 so if you want to make further changes you'll need that
most of the useful code is kept in the Calculator object and a single script holding the date counting functions
